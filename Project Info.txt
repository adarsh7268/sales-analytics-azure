Retail Analytics Pipeline

Overview:
This data engineering project demonstrates a full-scale implementation of the Medallion Architecture using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Data Factory (ADF), and Databricks. The objective is to design a modular and scalable data pipeline to ingest, transform, and serve data for analytical and business intelligence (BI) purposes.

Architecture Layers:

1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data Ingestion):
   - Tool: Azure Data Factory (ADF)
   - Pipeline: `df_git_to_bronze`
   - Function: Ingests multiple CSV files from HTTP sources (e.g., GitHub) into ADLS Bronze container.
   - Configuration-driven using a JSON config file and ForEach loop.
   - Writes raw data to `abfss://bronze@adstorage1234.dfs.core.windows.net/`.

2. Silver Layer (Data Transformation and Cleaning):
   - Tool: Azure Databricks
   - Script: Silver Layer Notebook
   - Function: Reads raw CSV files from the Bronze layer and performs cleansing and transformations using PySpark.
   - Examples:
     - Extracting `Year` and `Month` from dates
     - Creating full customer names
     - Normalizing product names and SKU
     - Parsing dates and standardizing formats
   - Writes clean, structured Parquet files to `abfss://silver@adstorage1234.dfs.core.windows.net/`.

3. Gold Layer (Business-Ready Views and Tables):
   - Tool: Azure Synapse Analytics (Serverless SQL Pool)
   - Script: Gold Layer SQL Script
   - Function: Creates external views and tables over the Silver layer using `OPENROWSET` and external tables.
   - Views created: `gold.sales`, `gold.customer`, `gold.product`, `gold.returns`, `gold.calender`, `gold.subcategories`, `gold.territories`
   - Enables querying and BI analysis without data movement.

Benefits:
- Modular, scalable, and cloud-native architecture
- Configuration-driven ingestion for easy extensibility
- Clean separation between raw, refined, and curated data
- Supports downstream analytics tools like Power BI or Synapse Studio

Technologies Used:
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Databricks (PySpark)
- Azure Synapse Analytics (Serverless SQL Pools)
- OAuth-based ADLS Access
- Parquet File Format
